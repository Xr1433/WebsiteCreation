      <h1 class="header1">What is the atmosphere?</h1>
       <p class="paragraph-format">The atmosphere is a fasinating environment, it keeps up warm, safe, and healthy, it even holds in our oxygen so we can breath!
             
         The Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, and Exosphere, these layers make up our atmosphere.

      <h3 id="atmospherelayer" class="header1">The Troposphere</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-format">This is the first and lowest layer in our atmosphere. This is the later we live in! In the troposphere, air is warmest near the ground and gets colder as you increase altitude. Most of weather takes place here, this is also the most dense atmospheric layer containing around 75-80% of the atmosphere.

    </p>
      <h3 id="atmospherelayer" class="header1">The Stratosphere</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-format">This is the second layer of our atmosphere. Commercial planes fly in the lower part of the stratosphere to avoid weather conditions in the troposphere. This layer also contains a large amount of ozone, which then obsorbs energy from ultraviolet radiation increasing the heat in this layer as you gain altitude.

    </p>
    <h3 id="atmospherelayer" class="header1">The Mesosphere</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-format">This is the third layer of our atmosphere. The Mesosphere is a mysterious layer, not much is known about it but, we do know that this is where most meteors burn up here. Aircraft cannot fly this high because there is little oxygen available for the engines. This layer also has very rare and strange clouds called "noctilucent clouds" they mainly form around the poles, these are the highest clouds you'll see.
