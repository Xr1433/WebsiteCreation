      <h3 id="coloredheader" class="header1">What is Climate?</h3>
  <p class="paragraph-format">The climate of our planet is a interesting thing, sometimes it is discused as a problem (Climate Change) which varies on opinion. Anyway, Climate is essentially weather conditions around the world over time. This means the climate of the earth is different all over. If you think about it, say where you live it's snowing and humid, you would say that your climate is <em>Cold</em> and <em>Humid</em>.

<h3 id="coloredheader" class="header1">What is Geography?</h3>
<p class="paragraph-format">Geography is the study of Earth's terrain, people and habitats. There is a couple types of geography including, human geography, physical geography, etc, but I will just focus on physical. Physical geography focuses on studing the terrain and it's environments, like mountains how they form what they are made of, that kind of stuff. Geography is very beautiful in my opinion, I think a lot of people don't want to explore because it's dangerous, but thats what makes it fun!<br>
