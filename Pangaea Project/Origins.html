      <p class="paragraph-format" style>Have you ever wondered how our continents were formed? Well first, our solar systems origins are much more amazing and beautiful than most people could imagine! I would explain how it all started but that would take around 13 billion years... I'll just start from around 300 million years ago, at this time our continents where just one called Pangaea, as well as our seas, Panthalassa. This is why we see fossils of simular animals in different continents. Anyway, "Pangaea" is derived from the greek gods; Pan, the god of the wild, meaning all or wild; Gaia, Goddess of earth, meaning Mother Earth or ground; dirt. I hope you enjoy the page!</p>
